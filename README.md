# dbt-avoid-chaos

This repo can be used to configure dbt projects and automatically deploy them.

It is part of [a talk made at Coalesce 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkQsGLhqF6I) in London.

## Overview of the demo

![Overview](docs/diagram.png)

Some key design considerations:

- All the dbt projects are managed in a single repository, different from the dbt repository itself
  - Another option would be to collocate the two, but keeping them separate makes it easier for the platform team to manage all projects from a single place
  - It is still possible to manage some Terraform configuration in the dbt project itself, like jobs, but it is a good idea to centralize the global best-practices and repo/warehouse connections. This also means that the dbt repo doesn't need any credential from git or the Data Warehouse and could use Terraform and dbt Cloud with a Service Token scoped to their project only
- Each project uses its own remote state
  - Having all projects using the same state would allow us to perform changes across all projects with a single `terraform plan/apply` but it also would make all the projects depending on each other.
  - With multiple states, if 1 project has a problem and `terraform plan` fails for some reason, the other projects can still be updated

## GH actions configured

- on PR creation, if a project was created or modified under deployments, `terraform plan` is executed separately on every folder
  - if changes are identified in the `deployments` folder, the PR will be automatically updated with the output of `terraform plan`
- on merge to `main`, if a project was created or modified under deployments, `terraform apply -auto-approve` is executed separately on every folder
- it is possible to manually trigger a `dbt destroy` on a project in case we need to delete an existing project

## Env vars / Secrets used

Secrets have been set in GitHub for

- the Terraform backend (using Postgres in this example but could be used for any other backend)
- the Terraform sensitive variables
  - they are all created as `TF_VAR_terraform_var_name`, like `TF_VAR_DBT_TOKEN`

## dbt projects config

The current configuration leverages

- some Terraform modules avialble on the repo [b-per/dbt-terraform-modules](https://github.com/b-per/dbt-terraform-modules)
  - those modules are used to create a repository, database objects and a dbt Cloud project
- a dbt project template, compatible with [Cruft](https://cruft.github.io/cruft/) and available at [b-per/dbt-project-template](https://github.com/b-per/dbt-project-template)

## Tips

To remove a project

1. trigger a manual `terraform destroy` action for the project to be removed
2. remove the files from the repo

In case the files have already been rmoved it is possible to trigger a `terraform destroy` on a previous branch/commit that still had the code.
